      "\n",
      "**Preparation:**\n",

      "1. **Mix dry ingredients:** Combine sand and cement in a large container, mixing thoroughly.  Aim for an even distribution of cement throughout the sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Add water gradually:** Slowly add water, mixing continuously with a shovel or hoe.  The mixture should be stiff but workable, similar to thick mud.  Too much water makes weak bricks; too little makes them difficult to mold.  Adjust water as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Fill the mold:** Firmly pack the mixture into the brick mold, ensuring no air pockets.  Use a trowel or similar tool to level the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Remove from mold:** After a few hours (or overnight for easier removal), carefully remove the bricks from the mold.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cure:** Place the bricks in a shaded area with good air circulation to cure for at least 7 days, keeping them damp (periodically mist with water).  This allows the cement to fully hydrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:**  These bricks are suitable for non-structural applications like decorative walls or pathways, not load-bearing structures.  For stronger bricks, use a higher cement-to-sand ratio.\n",

      "4. **Knead (optional):** Briefly knead for a minute or two, just to combine. The dough will remain quite rough.\n",
      "5. **Rest:** Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm place for at least 4 hours, or overnight for a better flavor.\n",
      "6. **Bake:** Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Grease a loaf pan (approx. 9x5 inches) generously with olive oil. Transfer the dough into the pan.  Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.  A darker crust is desired.\n",

      "1. **Boil water:** Bring water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add salt.\n",
      "2. **Add flour gradually:** Slowly add cassava flour to the boiling water, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula to prevent lumps.  The mixture will thicken rapidly.\n",
      "3. **Knead:** Once a thick dough forms, continue stirring and kneading vigorously with the spoon or your hands (if heat-tolerant).  This is crucial to develop the smooth, elastic texture.  Add a little more water if needed to reach desired consistency.\n",
      "4. **Finish:**  Continue kneading until a smooth, pliable dough forms (about 10-15 minutes).  It should be soft but not sticky.\n",
      "5. **Serve:** Serve immediately with your choice of stew or soup.  Fufu is typically eaten by tearing off pieces and using it to scoop up the accompanying food.\n",

Don't add too much water at once; adjust as needed to achieve the right consistency.  It should be thick enough to not be runny.\n",

      "4. **Ferment:** Pour into a clean jar, cover loosely (cheesecloth or lid with small holes), and let ferment at room temperature (20-25°C) for 6-8 hours, or until thickened.  Warmer temperatures will speed up fermentation.\n",
